ThoughtSpot engineering has performed extensive testing of the ThoughtSpot
appliance on various Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Amazon Elastic Block
Store (EBS) configurations for best performance, load balancing, scalability,
and reliability.

You can find information here on which configuration of memory, CPU, storage,
and networking capacity you should be running for your instances. There are also
details on how to configure your placement groups.

## Hardware configurations

There is only one available hardware configuration for deploying ThoughtSpot on
Amazon: `r4.16xlarge`

Below are charts depicting the specifications for the configuration for EC2 and
EBS requirements. Both EC2 and EBS requirements must be fulfilled to deploy on
Amazon.

|Instance name|Data capacity|vCPUs|DRAM|
|-------------|-------------|-----|----|
|r4.16xlarge|Up to 250 GB|64|488 GB|


|Instance name|Data capacity|Root volume (SSD)|Data volume (SSD or HDD)|
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
|r4.16xlarge|Up to 250 GB|1 vol 200 GB for each node|2 vols 1 TB each|



## ThoughtSpot software license sizes

ThoughtSpot only sells software licenses in multiples of 250 GB of data. So you
can start with 250 GB, and add increments of 250 GB each time your data capacity
needs increase. You can also choose to start off with more than 250 GB of data,
as long as you know the best fit configuration for your data volume.

## Lego blocks

If you aren't sure what kind of configuration you need, it might help to think
of the hardware configurations in terms of simple Lego blocks. The r4.16xlarge
size can be seen as a 250 GB block.

{% include note.html content="ThoughtSpot does not support sizes other than r4.16xlarge." %}

Since the minimum data volume offered is 250 GB, you would need one r4.16xlarge
block to match the data capacity. This scales linearly. So, 500 GB would require
two r4.16xlarge blocks.

## Regions, availability zones, and placement groups

AWS instances are configured to a location with regard to where the computing
resources are physically located. You must specify a region, an availability
zone, and below that, a placement group.

AWS nodes in a ThoughtSpot cluster must be in the same [availability zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html) (and, therefore, also in the same region).

A [placement group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html)
is a logical grouping of instances _within_ a single availability zone.
Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network
latency, high network throughput, or both.

ThoughtSpot relies on high connectivity between nodes of a cluster, which is why
creating a placement group is recommended. Being in same placement group will
give you the best shot at the highest bandwidth across AWS EC2 instances and the
lowest latencies. This will make the node-node network reach the closest AWS
promised specs. Our default recommendation for a multi-instance setup requires a
placement group since it works best for our application performance. Also, AWS
will provide jumbo frames (9000 MTU) support in such situations, and they don't
charge extra for being in the same placement group.

Having said that, ThoughtSpot will still work with EC2s in the cluster across
placement groups in an availability zone.
