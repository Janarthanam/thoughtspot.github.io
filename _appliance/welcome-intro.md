You can install a ThoughtSpot cluster on a hardware appliance, cloud service, or VMware appliance.
All ThoughtSpot nodes must be on the same platform and same subnet, and connectivity between any two nodes cannot be blocked. You can also deploy multiple clusters on multiple platforms, but you cannot host one cluster across multiple platforms.

This guide instructs you on how to prepare each of the following deployment options:

- [Hardware appliance]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/hardware/inthebox.html)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/aws/configuration-options.html)
- [Microsoft Azure]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/azure/configuration-options.html)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/gcp/configuration-options.html)
- [VMware]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/vmware/vmware-intro.html)

Starting with ThoughtSpot Release 6.0.4, you can also deploy ThoughtSpot through RHEL. See [RHEL Deployment Overview]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/rhel/rhel.html).

<!--After you configure your nodes, you can contact [ThoughtSpot
Support]({{ site.baseurl }}/appliance/contact.html) by phone, mail, email, or by filing a support ticket.-->
