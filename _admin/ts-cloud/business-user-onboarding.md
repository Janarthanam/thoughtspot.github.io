When you begin using ThoughtSpot, the onboarding process starts automatically and guides you through a few basic scenarios.

Usually, you receive an email welcoming you to the onboarding process at ThoughtSpot.

## Repeating the onboarding process

***\[Optional\]*** Any user can repeat their onboarding experience at any time. Simply select **Profile** from the user icon on the top right corner of the page, and under **Preferences > New user onboarding**, click **Revisit Onboarding**. See [Revisit onboarding]({{ site.baseurl }}/end-user/introduction/about-user.html#onboarding).

If you are a new user and you did not experience onboarding, please contact your administrator and request that they configure it for you and other new users.
